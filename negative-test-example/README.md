# negative-test-example

## Foreword

Negative testing is generally a pretty poor test methodology. Sometimes you'll run into flaky negative tests - these,
among other flaky tests, should be strong candidates for removal, or at least a discussion on alternative test options.
This repo is a very small example of a negative test that might be removed.
